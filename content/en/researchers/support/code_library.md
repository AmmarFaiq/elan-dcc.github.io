# Code Library
Discover a wealth of resources in the ELAN DCC GitHub Code Library, where researchers can share, reuse, and collaboratively improve code. These repositories are designed to foster innovation and efficiency, providing tools and scripts tailored to a wide range of research needs.

Explore and contribute to the repositories [here](https://github.com/elan-dcc?tab=repositories).

In the spirit of **Open Science** and adherence to the **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), all research projects will have their code archived on this account upon completion. This could involve creating a new repository or forking your repository to the **ELAN DCC GitHub account**, ensuring your work remains accessible and impactful for the wider ELAN research community.

Join us in making research more transparent, collaborative, and efficient!
