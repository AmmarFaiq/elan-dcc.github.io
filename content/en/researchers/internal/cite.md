# How to cite ELAN?
When using ELAN data in your research, it is mandatory to cite one or both of the following publications:
- [The introduction of a data-driven population health management approach in the Netherlands since 2019: The Extramural LUMC Academic Network data infrastructure]({{< relref "publications/2023-06-01_the-introductio/" >}} "The introduction")
- [Data Resource Profile: Extramural Leiden University Medical Center Academic Network (ELAN)]({{< relref "publications/2024-07-24_Data-Resource-P/" >}} "Data Resource Profile")

The following is an exemplary excerpt from a publication by Nynke Koning et al., *eClinicalMedicine*, 2019. **Please note that the following text is provided for illustrative purposes only and must not be reproduced verbatim.**

We performed a population-based cohort study among primary care patients aged XXX years who were registered with XXX practice centers (XXX GPs) that were affiliated with the ELAN primary care network (Extramural LUMC Academic Network) of the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), the Netherlands. The participating practices are located in the greater Leiden and The Hague area and are representative for Dutch primary care.

Our data consisted of the routine healthcare data anonymously extracted from the electronic medical records (EMRs) from the participating practices [19]. Available patient data included demographics, consultation dates, 
symptoms and diagnoses coded according to the WHO International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), prescribed medication coded according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification, laboratory test results, and descriptive or coded information of referrals and correspondence with other healthcare professionals e.g. profession/specialty of the other professional and date of referral and correspondence.
