# Data Request Costs for Research on the I-Drive
The following table outlines the costs associated with requesting and handling research data stored on the I-Drive at LUMC. The pricing varies depending on the main applicant's affiliation and the complexity of the request. For complex requests, such as those involving repetitive measurements, costs will be determined through collaborative discussion.
