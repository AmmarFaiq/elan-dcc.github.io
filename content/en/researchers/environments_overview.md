## Internal data infrastructure
{{< comment >}}Wat zit hier verder nog meer in? {{< /comment >}}
The internal data infrastructure houses the data from general practitioners in the ELAN region. In the Netherlands, practitioners keep track of their patient's health in a digital file called a *Medisch dosier*. This is updated via an interface known as a *Huisartsen Informatie Systeem*, HIS for short. In our database, every consultation, so points of contact between a patient and their practitioner, is known as a *journaal*. Every *episode* encapsulates all the *journaals* regarding a certain medical issue/condition.

For more information on the way this specific database is designed click [here]({{< relref "gp_data" >}} "About GP data").

{{< comment >}} TO DO: Margots file met hiaten:
Procedures: discuss dataset with data-manager, sign DTA, access PHEG I-drive, communicate updates with ELAN-team and WP-holder, submit paper to scientific board, share syntaxes, archive (no information in current guideline)
Possibility to go ‘back to the GP’ as there are pseudonymized data (see more information in governance document), information on ‘tegelproject’ or precision medicine (no information in current guideline)

## External Data Infrastructure
The external data infrastructure is hosted on the CBS servers, giving us access to vast amounts of data from a varied range of sources. Additionally, this infrastructure comes with added layers of security to prevent data being traced back to natural people, and to keep the data secure and the usage controlled and safe.

Within this infrastructure, researchers operate from within projects. Every project has access to different subsets of datasets. Dutch descriptions on all datasets being maintained by Statistics Netherlands can be found [here](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/maatwerk-en-microdata/microdata-zelf-onderzoek-doen/catalogus-microdata). If researchers require access to a dataset not made available in their project, they can contact the data manager.

Currently, there are 6 projects available for researchers to work from.

- **Project 9002: Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and complications**
    The mapping the risk factors, heath care usage, prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular diseases and complications and diabetes.
- **Project 9003: Health differences between different spatial levels (neighbourhoods and districts)**
    The investigation of regional health differences in the region Haaglanden and Hollands-Midden.
- **Project 9004: COVID-19**
    Gaining insights in socio-demographic determinants of the spread and severity of COVID-19
- **Project 9005: Patient Flows**
    The exploration of referrals and flow of people between primary, secondary care and social domain
- **Project 9020: Population Health Information System**
    The exploration of the extent of which privacy sensitive information needs to be linked to support Population Health Management.
- **Project 9269: Socio-demographic determinants of mental health issues and illnesses**
    The identification of socio-demographic determinants of the developmental course of mental health problems.
