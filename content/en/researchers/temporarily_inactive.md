# What to do when temporarily inactive?
Researchers may need to pause their research for various reasons. If your break extends for several months, inform the ELAN scientific board and your Principal Investigator (PI).

## If you're using the external environment
If you are active in the external environment, notify the data manager. Your account will be temporarily suspended, preserving all intermediate results and code.

Once you are able to resume your analysis, inform the data manager to reinstate your account.

## If you're using the internal environment
No action is required.
