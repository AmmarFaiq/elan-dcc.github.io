# What to do when temporarily inactive?
Researchers may need to take a break from their research for varied reasons. If you are taking a break of several months, we would appreciate it if you would contact us.

## If you're using the external environment
If you're active in the external environment, do contact the data manager. Your account for the external environment will be temporarily suspended until you are able to return to your analysis. You will not lose any (intermediate) results or code if you do this.

Once you are able to continue your analysis at the external environment, all you need to do is inform the data manager, and he will get your account reinstated.

## If you're using tthe internal environment
You're good!
