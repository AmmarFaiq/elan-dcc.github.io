# Hadoks
[Hadoks](https://www.hadoks.nl/) short for Haaglandse dokters, is an organization established by and for general practitioners in the Haaglanden region. Their mission is to elevate the quality of care services provided by general practices spread across The Hague, Wassenaar, Rijswijk and Leidschendam-Voorburg. Care services include two departments: 

1. **Primary Emergency Care:** providing urgent care services for approximately 600 GPs in the region, covering out-of-hours care, and

1. **Quality Support:** Assisting around 150 practices with the implementation of structured care programmes, including Diabetes Type 2, cardiovascular diseases and risk management, COPD, and asthma, and care for vulnerable older adults.

Hadoks systematically records data on care delivered during evening, night, weekend, and holiday shifts, known in Dutch as Avond-Nacht-Weekend-zorg (ANW-zorg). This includes both planned and unplanned, as well as routine and acute care, provided across three emergency GP centers: HMC Westeinde, HMC Antoniushove, and Haga Hospital.

## Criteria for evaluation
Researchers interested in accessing Hadoks’s data must align (part of) their research with at least one of Hadoks’s core ambitions:

- **Regional and community-focused care:** Improving healthcare delivery at the regional and neighbourhood levels, by, for instance, solving a regional bottleneck.

- **Enhancing delivery of patient care:** Supporting associated practices with tools and knowledge to provide optimal care either to chronic patients in daily practice or to improve delivery of emergency care.

Therefore, your research should offer practical insights, whether it’s uncovering unique neighbourhood characteristics within the region, solving a regional bottleneck, or providing a deeper understanding of the patient population.
