# Overview of steps to initiate data analysis
To use the ELAN infrastructure and its data, you will need to take the steps shown in the flow chart below.
Some of the providers of our data, and for certain types of research, some additional steps need to be taken. These are displayed in the flow chart by selecting the following buttons if they are applicable to your situation.

{{< processselection class="content-gallery" >}}
    {{< processselectionoption value="mentalhealth" text="I want to use mental health data." >}}
    {{< processselectionoption value="hospital" text="I want to use hospital data." >}}
    {{< processselectionoption value="hadoks" text="I want to use hadoks data." >}}
    {{< processselectionoption value="perined" text="I want to use perined data." >}}
    {{< processselectionoption value="wmo" text="I want to use wmo data." >}}
{{< /processselection >}}

The purple boxes are links to additional information or to platforms that allow you to perform the action in question.

You may have already finished writing your research protocol, in which case you can submit that to your ELAN ticket.

**Note that you need to follow *all* paths coming from each box**

Ik heb niet duidelijk in mijn aantekeningen aangegeven waarom we "I want to use GP data" gingen toevoegen. Ik weet dat het iets te maken had met de steering committee.
