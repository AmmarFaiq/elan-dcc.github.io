# Requesting Data: A Step-by-Step Guide
To use the ELAN infrastructure and its data, you will need to take the steps shown in the flow chart below.
Some of the providers of our data, and for certain types of research, some additional steps need to be taken. These are displayed in the flow chart by selecting the following buttons if they are applicable to your situation.

Note that you can also get access to free data for text mining when using general practitioner data and hospital data.


{{< processselection class="content-gallery" text="Select what data you plan on using">}}
    {{< processselectionoption value="gp" text="General practitioner data" >}}
    {{< processselectionoption value="mentalhealth" text="Mental health data" >}}
    {{< processselectionoption value="hospital" text="Hospital data" >}}
    {{< processselectionoption value="hadoks" text="Hadoks data" >}}
    {{< processselectionoption value="perined" text="Perined data" >}}
    {{< processselectionoption value="wmo" text="WMO data" >}}
{{< /processselection >}}

The purple boxes are links to additional information or to platforms that allow you to perform the action in question.

You may have already finished writing your research protocol, in which case you can submit that to your ELAN ticket.

**Note that you need to follow *all* paths coming from each box**
