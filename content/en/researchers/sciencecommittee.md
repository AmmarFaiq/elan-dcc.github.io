# Obtaining approval from the PHEG Science Committee

The PHEG Science Committee ensures the quality of research at the department and evaluates research protocols based on their scientific content, relevance and feasibility. 

## Submission requirements:
For review, submit your final protocol with all relevant documents (in Word) to the PHEG Science Committee (email Wetenschapscommissie_PHEG@lumc.nl):

- [Application Form for the Research Protocol](https://www.lumc.nl/siteassets/over-het-lumc/afdelingen/pheg/bestanden/aanmeldformulier-protocol-wetenschapscommissie-pheg-versie-13-11-2023.pdf)
- [Non-WMO submission letter (A1 'Niet-WMO aanbiedingsbrief'template only available in Dutch)](https://www.metc-ldd.nl/nwmo-en-mdr-documenten)
- [Non-WMO questionnaire (B2 'Niet-WMO vragenlijst'template only available in Dutch)](https://www.metc-ldd.nl/nwmo-en-mdr-documenten)
- [Final protocol (C1)]

On behalf of the PHEG science committee, members of the ELAN-research team will give them an advice by filling in a short checklist (see link ). The Science Committee will then communicate their final decision to the researcher.

Next step (see flowchart) is to submit all documents (A1, B2, C1) and the letter of approval (K1) to the nwmo-committee of division 3: see www.metc-ldd.nl/indienen-niet-wmo-en-mdr. Once you have received the letter with approval of exemption from WMO review, upload this letter of approval and the final protocol to your ticket at www.elanresearch.nl .

We are aware that this process is burdensome: we are working on speeding up this process!

## Background
A research project that (solely) uses retrospective patient data (like ELAN) is exempt from the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO). In that case, the METC-LDD asks you to submit your protocol to the so called non-wmo-committee of your division (div-3). Of note: sometimes when multiple datasets are be linked together, a research project may fall under the WMO. 

Every department of the LUMC has its own science committee. For the LUMC, the designated medical ethics committee is the METC-LDD (www.metc-ldd.nl). When submitting a protocol to the METC-LDD, you are obliged to add the letter of approval from the designated science committee.

To get your research published, many (medical) journals request a confirmation/letter of approval from a medical ethics committee. That is why we advise you to submit any research intended for publication, including research with ELAN-data. Of note, as it is a prerequisite for ELAN-research to ‘serve the general interest’ publication will be the default.
