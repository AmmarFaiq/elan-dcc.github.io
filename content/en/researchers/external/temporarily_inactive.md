# What to do when temporarily inactive?
Researchers may, for various reasons, need to temporarily pause their work. If your period of inactivity extends beyond several months, you are required to notify the ELAN Scientific Board and your Principal Investigator (PI). Additionally, please inform the data manager ({{< person who="external" >}}) of your circumstances.

During this period, your account and its associated costs will be temporarily suspended, ensuring that all intermediate results and code are securely preserved.

When you are ready to resume your research activities, contact the data manager to reactivate your account.
