# How to cite ELAN?

## Internal environment
The following is an exemplary excerpt from a publication by Nynke Koning et al., *eClinicalMedicine*, 2019. Please note that this text must not be reproduced verbatim.

We performed a population-based cohort study among primary care patients aged XXX years who were registered with XXX practice centers (XXX GPs) that were affiliated with the ELAN primary care network (Extramural LUMC Academic Network) of the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), the Netherlands. The participating practices are located in the greater Leiden and The Hague area and are representative for Dutch primary care.

Our data consisted of the routine healthcare data anonymously extracted from the electronic medical records (EMRs) from the participating practices [19]. Available patient data included demographics, consultation dates, 
symptoms and diagnoses coded according to the WHO International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), prescribed medication coded according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification, laboratory test results, and descriptive or coded information of referrals and correspondence with other healthcare professionals e.g. profession/specialty of the other professional and date of referral and correspondence.
