# Importing data in the external environment
If your dataset contains information about individuals and you intend to link it with existing datasets in the external environment at CBS, the CBS must assign Record Identification Numbers (RINs) to the individuals in your dataset. To initiate this process, contact the DCC. **Do not** send your dataset directly to CBS.

A RIN, or Record Identification Number, is an artificial identifier generated by CBS. The process of assigning RINs, known as 'rinning,' pseudonymises the data, ensuring individuals cannot be directly identified without additional information. A person present in multiple datasets will be assigned the same RIN across all datasets.

- The preferred method: by [Citizen Service number (BSN)](https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/citizen-service-number-bsn)
- probabilistic linkage, by providing as much detailed information as possible, including: gender, birthdate and address details. Address details include street name, house number, postal code, and the residency starting and ending dates. For the postal code, PC6 is preferred, but PC4 could be used as a fall-back.
