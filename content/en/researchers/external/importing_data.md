# Importing data in the external environment
If your data is about people that you want to link with existing datasets in the external environment at CBS, CBS needs to "rin" the population of your data set. If you want to do this, make sure to contact the DCC. Do **not** mail the CBS your dataset directly.

The noun RIN is an abbreviation for Record Identification Number, which is an artificial ID created by CBS. When people are being "rinned", they are being pseudonymised, meaning that they can no longer be attributed to a natural person without the use of additional information. If someone is present in multiple datasets, that person will have the same RIN in all those datasets.

{{< comment >}} Via DCC ipv via Frank?? Is het een idee om de link die hier in de guidance doc staat in een standaard e-mail te zetten als Frank zo'n request heeft goedgekeurd? https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/our-services/customised-services-microdata/microdata-conducting-your-own-research/importing-external-datasets {{< /comment >}}.

- The preferred method: by [Citizen Service number (BSN)](https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/citizen-service-number-bsn)
- probabilistic linkage, by providing as much detailed information as possible, including: gender, birthdate and address details. Address details include street name, house number, postal code, and the residency starting and ending dates. For the postal code, PC6 is preferred, but PC4 could be used as a fall-back.

{{< comment >}} Bij BSN preferred method gezet, die is ten slotte goedkoper! {{< /comment >}}
