# Data Request Costs for Research at CBS

The table below summarizes the costs associated with requesting and using routine (care) data within the CBS Remote Access (CBS-RA) environment. Costs are calculated and charged by Statistics Netherlands (SN) based on specific activities:

- **Environment Usage**: SN calculates costs per researcher for access to the CBS-RA environment.
- **Microdata Usage**: Researchers are charged for accessing microdata files.
- **Output Check**: A mandatory output check is conducted by SN to ensure the data cannot be traced back to individuals.
- **Uploading Own Data**: Researchers can upload their own data, with costs depending on the encryption method.
- **External Data**: There are no charges for other available data provided by external parties.

Costs are updated annually by SN. For the most recent pricing, refer to the official CBS page: [CBS Microdata Services and Costs](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/maatwerk-en-microdata/microdata-zelf-onderzoek-doen/diensten-en-kosten).
