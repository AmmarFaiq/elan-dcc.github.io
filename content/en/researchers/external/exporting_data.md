# Exporting data from the external environment
Data, as available in the external environment cannot ever be exported as is. However, once you've produced aggregated (intermediate) results, these can be exported from the external environment. To do this, one needs to request CBS Microdata to review the output. They will check if the output meets the quality standards provided by them, ensuring results can not be traced back to natural persons.

There are costs involved with every request for CBS to check output. The CBS does not charge the **amount** of files up for review, therefore we request all the researchers within the same <a href="../../environments_overview#external-data-infrastructure">projects</a> to pool their (intermediate) results to save us costs.

Additionally, you can export your code (or "syntax" as it is called by CBS) from the environment. This can be requested any time, and the checks on code are free. When you finish your analysis at CBS's RA, always export as much as your code as possible to place it online. This is to promote open science and to help fellow researchers who may be tackling similar issues.

The output guidelines and the process to export data and code can be found [here](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/our-services/customised-services-microdata/microdata-conducting-your-own-research/export-of-information).

## Review duration
We strongly advise you start exporting your data at least a week in advance. CBS has 3 working days to review the output once presented to them, and they may provide feedback you have to implement before it can be exported.

## What next?
If you've received your final output and you no longer plan on making use of the external environment, contact the data manager. The data manager will ask you to put all your code in a zipped file, and he will request CBS to deactivate your account at CBS.

{{< comment >}} Willen we dat er een beter systeem komt dat onderzoekers binnen projecten met elkaar kunnen communiceren over export? Het gebeurt bijv wel voor 9002 via WA, maar, naar mijn weten, niet voor 9003. {{< /comment >}}

{{< comment >}} Moeten we ook de kosten vermelden? Nee, toch? {{< /comment >}}
