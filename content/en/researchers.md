# Researcher Hub
To utilise the ELAN infrastructure and its data, please refer to our [overview of the steps to initiate data analysis](https://elan-dcc.github.io/researchers/overview_getting_started/).
You are also welcome to attend the weekly meetings of the [ELAN knowledge sharing group](https://lumconline.sharepoint.com/sites/ELANKnowledgeSharing), where we connect and support ELAN researchers, providing an opportunity to ask questions and engage in collaborative discussions.
