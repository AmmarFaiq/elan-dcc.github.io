# For the researchers

To use the ELAN infrastructure and its data, see our [overview of steps to initiatie data analysis](https://elan-dcc.github.io/researchers/overview_getting_started/).
You can join the meetings of the [ELAN knowledge sharing group](https://lumconline.sharepoint.com/sites/ELANKnowledgeSharing). Here we connect and empower ELAN researchers, with the opportunity to ask questions.
Once your research is complete, but before submission or publication, please see the following steps to be taken [here](https://elan-dcc.github.io/researchers/finish/).
